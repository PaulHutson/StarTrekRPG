    I've been serving with Doctor Kerensky for the past month and have found him to be very agreeable.  He has always been willing to lend his knowledge to tasks that he asks me to perform - this has helped my research projects move along in leaps and bounds.
    <br /><br />
    The day to day tasks that always used to frustrate Doctor Forrester don't seem to bother Doctor Kerensky - he seems to take it all in his stride unlike the previous doctor who often seemed to feel that those sorts of things were beneath him (especially when he was working on his own experiments - most of which were "closed door").  It has been great to have a Doctor willing to get stuck in alongside me.
