    The new command staff that have been assigned to the Brazier seem very effective.  The Captain is a typical Vulcan but guided us through the first few weeks of our patrolling with efficiency.

    The recent incident with the transport has affirmed my thoughts about the command staff, it was good to see that they were able to effectively ascertain the origin of the illegal transportation of the aliens from the neutral zone.  Although I didn't meet the two people who were brought aboard from the ship, I was curious about their names; having gone over my old logs I've found that the Captain Sunir [the old Captain of the Brazier] mentioned the name Smyth a number of times... although I'm not sure if the person hew as referring to was the same person.
