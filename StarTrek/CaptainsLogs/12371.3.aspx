	We’ve been back on patrol for 10 days since our encountering the sentient computer virus. The ship continues to
	show no signs of the virus and we have encountered no other vessels since re-establishing our course along the
	border with the neutral zone.
	<br />
	<br />
	I was meditating in my quarters when 1st Officer Lieutenant Commander Ragis called from the bridge to say we had
	picked up an automated distress call from a nearby Starfleet research station and that the station was
	unresponsive to hails.
	<br />
	<br />
	I called Lieutenant Via to the bridge and headed there myself. Via was able to scan the station allowing us to
	identify it as a science station studying spatial phenomenon. The station is approximately 1 hour away at warp 5.
	Unable to tell much from our current position I ordered the helm to take us in closer, a distance of half a
	light year would allow us to get more detailed scans without revealing our position. At the same time Ragis
	contacted Starfleet to get more details on the station.
	<br />
	<br />
	We dropped out of warp half a light year from the station as expected, Lieutenants Via and Lacey were able to
	get a better look at the station. We detected an unidentified ship docked on the far side of the station. The
	station was heavily shielded but lacked any weapons. We could detect 25 life signs onboard the station but
	the sensors could tell us little else due to the shielding on the station.
	<br />
	<br />
	At this point we received a communication back from Starfleet with the crew manifest for the station. There are
	eight full time Starfleet scientists along with two visiting civilian scientists including the renowned temporal
	physicist Dr Marnal. The fifteen unknown life signs and presents of the unknown vessel were of concern.
	<br />
	<br />
	We needed more information, the logical course of action was to move within visual range of the station and the
	unknown vessel. As we approached we raised shields and went to tactical alert while there was still response to
	hails. Once we were within visual range we could see the vessel was old and appeared undamaged. There were no
	discernable markings on it hull but clearly a human configuration.
	<br />
	<br />
	I ordered Lieutenant Shar to assemble a boarding party and the helm to dock with the station. As we began moving
	closer ready to dock we received a transmission from the station.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Unknown: "We will destroy the station if dock."</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "This is Captain Spydor of the USS Brazier, with whom am I speaking?"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Unknown: "We will destroy the station if dock."</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	At this point we backed off to reassess the situation. Scans of the unknown vessel revealed a single Nausicaan
	biosign. We has another sub space transmission from Starfleet indicating that the research being done on the
	station was classified. Trying again to communicate with the station:
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "We won’t come any closer. We are responding to your destress call do you require help?"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Unknown: "The beacon was accidentally activated, we do not require help. Disengage and move away."</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Needing more information to proceed but not wanting to alert the unknown individuals a decision was taken to transport
	Lieutenant Shar on to the unknown vessel while simultaneously transporting the Nausicaan to the brig. Before we
	executed the transports I headed to the brig with Via where we were joined Chief Medical Officer Alec Kerensky,
	leaving Ragis in charge on the bridge.
	<br />
	<br />
	Ned’s ability at the transport console served us well and the simultaneous transports went off without an issue
	and the Nausicaan materialised in the brig. Immediately he started discharging his weapon. The force field contained
	the particle discharge from the Nausicaans weapon but in an effort to disable his weapon Ned discharged a local EMP.
	This did not go very well as a few moments later we came to with red lights illuminating the brig and the Nausicaan
	coming straight at us.
	<br />
	<br />
	In the ensuing struggle we managed to subdue the Nausicaan but not before he got some damaging blows in.
	Ultimately I was left in some discomfort but the Vulcan neck pinch was effective. Via and Alec were uninjured
	by the incident and Alec took the Nausicaan to sick bay where he was restrained. The EMP had knocked out
	power to most of the deck including the turbo lifts and transporter array.
	<br />
	<br />
	By this time Shar had reported in. He had been unable to access the computers on the bridge, they were all
	locked out and he was heading to the airlock at the docking port to investigate further.
	<br />
	<br />
	Via was assisting Ned with restoring the power to the deck but progress was slow. Best estimates would give
	us power in 10-15 minutes and the transporter another 10 minutes.
	<br />
	<br />
	Shar had now reached the airlock, reporting back that it had no window to the station and that he had sealed
	it shut with his phase pistol, but the that had set off alarms in the station. He was heading back to the
	bridge when some one tried to reach a Berilo on the comms.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Unknown: "Berilo are you there? respond…"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Shar (imitating the Nausicaan): "everything is fine."</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Unknown: "We’re coming back to the ship, stand by…"</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Communicating with Ragis on the bridge Star requests we stand by for emergency transport, but is told about
	our power/transporter issues and ordered with sit tight. Taking cover in the corridor two unknowns reach
	the airlock and start trying to cut through. Fortunately the door was well sealed and it took about 15
	minutes for them to open it. Multiple hostiles started through the door as Shar requested transport.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Shar: "Get me out of here…"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Ragis: "We have power but transporters are still down, we need more time."</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Shar opened fire on the hostiles hitting one and forcing the others to take cover behind the airlock door. 
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Unknown: "Come out…"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Shar: "Don’t come any closer or I’ll blow up the ship."</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Unknown: "Throw down your weapon and come out, you won’t be harmed."</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Shar opened fire again, getting off another three shots, connecting with two of them, as he made a dash
	of the lift opposite his current position. As he rolled into the lift Ned got a transported lock and got
	him safely back to the Brazier.
	<br />
	<br />
	I was still in the brig as the turbo lifts were not online yet when I got a report from Ragis on the bridge.
	We had been hailed by the station with the following message, “Return Berilo or we will start killing
	scientists! You have five minutes”. Ragis noted that the unknown human sounded desperate and had ended the
	transmission before he had a chance to respond. Given the time sensitive nature of the current situation
	Via was able to initiate a mind meld with the Nausicaan (Berilo). He encountered resistance trying to find
	where he was from but got the distinct impression he was not a bad person and that they wanted information
	from the scientists about spacetime.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "Captain Spydor to the bridge."</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Lieutenant Commander Ragis: "Yes captain…"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "Open a channel to the station and patch me through."</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Lieutenant Commander Ragis: "Channel open go ahead…"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "This is Captain Spydor of the USS Brazier, we’ll return your
		man but you need to disengage from the station before we can transport him."</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	After a tense moment the unknown hostiles came over the comm agreeing the the terms. They wanted 10 minutes
	to get their people back on the ship and disengage. Meanwhile New reported that core systems were back online,
	but it would be three hours at least until everything was fixed. This allowed me to use the turbo lifts to
	return to the bridge. In sickbay Alec woke the Nausicaan, after an initial struggle he managed to reassure
	him and things calmed down, but was total unresponsive to any questioning.
	<br />
	<br />
	As the ship disengaged from the station we were able to establish contact with the scientists. They reported
	that no one was hurt, in shock maybe but ok, and the intruders had taken Dr Marnal and his colleague with
	them. There was some damage to the station so we transported a couple of engineers to assist in repairs.
	<br />
	<br />
	As we transported help to the station, the hostile ship jumped to warp. We were able to follow their warp
	trail and with some upgrades to our targeting array disable their engines with a couple of precision phase
	cannot strikes. As the ship dropped out of warp Ragis hailed them. Before we could say anything the message
	“Back off or we will destroy the ship!” Came through and the comm signal was cut.
	<br />
	<br />
	Despite their best efforts Via and Ned were unable to distinguish Dr Marnal and his colleague from the other
	humans on the ship. Only being able to transport a six individuals at once and not wanted to send an armed
	boarding party we started to transport people from the ship to the brig, where Alec had filled the cells with
	a harmless knockout gas. We beamed the first six humans but none were the scientists, the gas did its job
	and security were able to secure the hostiles without and trouble. As we prepared to transport the next six,
	Via reported picking up something being expelled form the airlock on the hostile ship. At the same time we
	received a hail from the ship reporting one the scientists had been executed.
	<br />
	<br />
	We were able to beam the next six out at this point and along with 5 hostiles we recovered Dr Marnal. In
	the final transport we got 2 Romulans, who were unaffected by the gas but the containment filed in the held
	them. We were able to recover the corpse of Dr Marnal colleague on the way back to the station where our
	engineers had completed repairs. Once they were safely back on board we set a course back to base. Enroute
	Alec revived Dr Marnal from the effects of the gas, he was physically ok but clearly traumatised by the ordeal
	specially the loss of a colleague.
	<br />
	<br />
	When we arrived at the space station the prisoners where transferred to the Star Fleet security team and
	we were able to refuel and make repairs. I met with Admiral Sexton who thanked the crew for their service
	in returning Dr Marnal to safety.
