	Following a more in depth analysis of the virus we encountered some weeks back we have been ordered to
	join a special task force being led by Admiral Sexton himself. This virus was coded to take all ships to
	a specific area of space within the neutral zone. Our investigative fleet, totalling tens ships including
	us, has been granted dispensation by the Romulans to enter the neutral zone. The Brazier is the oldest
	ship in the fleet, curiously this seems to bring much amusement to some of the other Captains.
	<br />
	<br />
	As we crossed into the neutral zone we held position in the centre of the formation. On our approach to
	the target co-ordinates Lieutenant Shar reported spacial distortions on scanners, these readings were
	confirmed with the other ships. While we were still 15 minutes away the lead ship reported turbulence
	just before passing through some kind of barrier and disappearing from all sensor and visual scans.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Admiral Sexton: </strong>“All stop, lets see if they come back.”</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Lieutenant Via was unable to get any readings from beyond the barrier. After thirty minutes there was no
	sign of the lead ship and nothing on sensors. Admiral Sexton launched a probe but all telemetry stopped
	being received the moment the probe passed through the barrier.
	<br />
	<br />
	Having been unable to get any more data Sexton ordered the fleet to approach and pass through the barrier.
	Passing through the barrier was a rough ride but the Brazier held together with only minor damage to
	sub-systems and no reported injuries.
	<br />
	<br />
	The new region of space we entered was quite empty and the stars had clearly shifted from their previous
	position. Lieutenant Kerensky was working in astronavigation but unfortunately overloaded and blew out
	his console while trying to pinpoint our position. The lead ship was now back on sensors. First officer
	Ragis tried to hail them but received only a garbled transmission in return.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Admiral Sexton:</strong> (audio only) “We seem to be having communications issues,
		continue on your previous heading all ships are accounted for.”</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Lieutenant Via was conducting continuous scans as we proceeded but was reporting that our sensor range
	was reduced for an unknown reason. Additionally helm control was reporting propulsion system were sub-optimal.
	<br />
	<br />
	Lieutenant Lacey was able to get astronavigation sensors back online following Snail’s incident and we started
	detecting an echo of a small object 15 minutes ahead. Ned and Via had been working on the sensors and were able
	to get a detailed scan of the object. It was a metallic sphere 20 meters in diameter. There were no life signs
	aboard but we were able to detect a number of systems including sensor arrays, and propulsion. The sphere also
	had an indeterminate opening in its outer hull. Ragis tried to hail the sphere and got a coded message back.
	It was going to take some time to decipher the response.
	<br />
	<br />
	A few minutes later the lead ship lost all power and started drifting. One by one the other ships started
	doing the same. Ragis tried to hail all ships to tell them to stop but was only able to raise three of them.
	All other ships had now lost power and were drifting. Surprisingly of the remaining ships none had seen the
	sphere on sensors. Ned was able to transmit some modifications to them to fix this.
	<br />
	<br />
	Via was detecting faint EM transmissions coming from the sphere directed at the disabled ships. We were
	unable to raise the six disabled ships or detect any power signatures. Even backups seemed to be offline.
	We made an attempt to use the grappler to pull Admiral Sextons ship back to safety. Our attempt failed
	and as one of the other ships manoeuvred into position to try they lost power too.
	<br />
	<br />
	Ragis and Via had managed to decipher to the response from the sphere. The message was “State designation,
	send code.”. Ragis was able to send a coded message back to the sphere with our designation and we received
	an acknowledgement. We approached the sphere at one quarter impulse and sure enough were able to get closer
	with no loss of power. We transmitted details to the two remaining ships, they transmitted their coded
	designations to the sphere and then approached. Illogically both lost power in the same way as the rest
	of the fleet as they got nearer to the sphere.
	<br />
	<br />
	Some time had now passed since the lead ships had lost power and our concern for their wellbeing without
	life support had grown. We needed to act quickly, Ned suggested using our ship like a shield to block the
	EM transmission from the sphere. I order the helm to take move into position as Ned had suggested. Sure
	enough as maundered into place the other ships started to regain power.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Admiral Sexton:</strong> “Good work Brazier, hold position while the fleet moves to
		safety.”</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Once the fleet was safely out of range of the sphere we were able to contact Dr Marnel on Admiral Sextons
	ship. He was unable to offer any immediate insight into the phenomenon or the sphere but was glad to receive
	all our sensor readings for analysis.
	<br />
	<br />
	Wanting to gather more information about the sphere to find a way that the whole fleet could more safely past I
	ordered Ned to prepare a probe to transport inside the sphere. Shar managed to beam a probe across and data
	started coming in. Visually the inside of the sphere was empty however we were able to detect a warp like
	power supply and technology that was clearly based on older federation equipment but had been significantly
	modified. There was no atmosphere in side the sphere and also no life signs. I decided to send an away team
	to investigate further.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Captain Spydor:</strong> “Lieutenants Via, Shar and Lacey get your EV suits on and
		prepare to beam to the sphere.”</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Once on board the sphere the Via was able to find a panel that appeared to be a computer terminal. It was
	in an unfamiliar language, fortunately Ragis was on hand back on the Brazier to help with the translation.
	Ned started to investigate the spheres power source to try and find any relation to the barrier we
	had passed through. He managed to quantum date the metal of the spheres hull, this indicated it was
	manufactured four years ago.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Comms Officer:</strong> “Captain, we have an incoming transmission from Admiral
		Sexton.”</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Captain Spydor:</strong> “On screen…”</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Admiral Sexton:</strong> “Dr Marnel has made some progress, we don’t know what
		to make of the sphere but we have been able to confirm our position has not changed passing through
		the barrier, but the starts shifted. The data suggests there would be no issue passing through the
		barrier the other way.”</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Meanwhile Via and Ragis had made some progress with the spheres systems. We could control the auxiliary
	systems but there was still a way to go before they could have it all figured out. Still investigating the
	spheres power Ned had made it through a number of hatches into the outer shell of the sphere. Within the
	outer shell was the main emitter array, and various access panels containing pulsating power conduits.
	<br />
	<br />
	A while later Via had cracked the spheres computer systems and was able to shut off the power. Communicating
	this back to Admiral Sexton he ordered the fleet to continue past the sphere instructing us to take the lead
	and leaving one of the smaller vessels behind to study the sphere in more detail.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Captain Spydor:</strong> “Prepare to beam our people back. Helm once they are on
		board resume previous heading, warp four.”</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Several hours later Via picked up an unknown planetary body on long range sensors, about ten hours from
	our current position. After talking with the Admiral we continued towards the plant. As we drew closer
	Sexton ordered the fleet to hold position while we moved closer to investigate. It was an M class planet,
	as we entered a high orbit we could detect a reasonable sized settlement, and empty space port and many
	different life signs on the planet, some human.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Lieutenant Ragis:</strong> “Captain, we’re being hailed from the planet.”</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic"><strong>Captain Spydor:</strong> “On screen…”</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	An older looking man appeared on the view screen, he was dressed in roughly hue clothing, “Welcome to planet
	Stax. My name is Protectorate Martin, I’m the leader of this colony. All are welcome here.”
	<br />
	<br />
	I thought this man look familiar but hearing his name confirmed my thoughts. He was on the manifest from the
	previous crew of the Brazier. Martin agreed to meet us and following a report to the Admiral I beamed to the
	surface with Ragis, Via, Shar, Snail, and Ned.
	<br />
	<br />
	The planet appeared dilapidated but we were greeted by two men at what appeared to be the reception area
	of the largest building in sight. They asked us to follow them to meet Protectorate Martin. We followed
	them through a number of corridors into an office. Protectorate Martin got up from behind a desk and welcomed
	us with traditional human handshakes. Snail was able to subtly take a medical scan of Martin, he appeared in
	good health, slightly undernourished but otherwise ok. There were low levels of toxins in the atmosphere,
	but nothing to be concerned about.
	<br />
	<br />
	Martin confirmed it was the year we thought, although appeared surprised by this question and looked around
	oddly at the other men in the room before answering. Martin told us a bit about the colony’s history, it had
	been founded 20 years ago by their leader Jeremy Watson. Currently away from the colony exploring.
	They were aware of the anomaly surrounding the region. When asked if it were keeping them here he answered
	no after an awkward pause and some odd looks to his fellow colonists. Their ships were unaffected by the
	spheres so they had not paid much attention to them. Additionally they had seen some unmanned ships in the
	region from time to time but never had any issues with them.
	<br />
	<br />
	We asked Martin about his time on the Brazier. He claimed to have had a good career in and fond memories or
	the Brazier, he had left Starfleet for a new life as a colonist. This story seemed odd to me and Snail
	seconded my interpretation feeling Martin was being less than honest. He gave us permission to explore
	the colony and arranged a tour of the hydroponics facilities for Snail. Martin himself took Snail around
	the hydroponics bays but there was nothing unusual there. Snail then rejoined the rest of us in the market place.
	<br />
	<br />
	While looking around the market Ragis found an establishment that looked like a shop but inside some less
	than reputable characters were sat around. Ragis suggested we could help then leave the planet if they wanted.
	This was met with some resistance, the men said they could leave but would only end up back here as that is what
	happens to everyone. Shar, in true Andorian style got a little upset by the mens tone and had to be pulled
	away from the resulting physical altercation.
	<br />
	<br />
	One intriguing piece of information Ragis managed to get the from the men in the shop was that Protectorate
	Martin had been on the colony for four or five years. This seemed to contradict Starfleet records. I
	confirmed with the crew back on the Brazier and sure enough our records indicated he only left Starfleet
	eight months ago, following an incident with another crew member. I tried to find Martin to confront him
	about this but he had seemingly disappeared and no-one was able or willing to say where he had gone.
	<br />
	<br />
	Always looking for people to help Snail had visited the hospital to see if he could help the locals. Sure
	enough they were in need of some supplies so Snail, Ned and I headed back to the ship.
	<br />
	<br />
	Via, Shar and Raggis requested to stay on the planet to see what else they could find out. After some hours
	in the local inn and some kind on physical competition between Shar and a Naussican they had not learned
	much apart that the people seemed fairly happy. Maybe that was due to intoxication.
	<br />
	<br />
	Back on the Brazier Snail had arranged to transport some medical supplies to the hospital that were
	greatly received.
