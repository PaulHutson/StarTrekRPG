	It's been seventeen days since we left the space station after delivering Smyth and Harry to federation custody.
	With the Brazier serviced and my new Ops Office, Lieutenant Shar, onboard it's been a largely uneventful period
	patrolling the boarder with the neutral zone.
	<br />
	<br />
	At 7pm I was called to the bridge by Lieutenant Commander Ragis, interrupting my meeting with Lieutenant Shar
	but the commander insisted it was urgent, reporting a vessel had been detected on long range scanners inside the
	neutral zone.
	<br />
	<br />
	By the time we arrived at the bridge Lieutenant Via was already there and busy at work with the scanners. After a
	few moments we learned the ship was an older Romulan vessel travelling at low warp on an intercept course with us.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "How long to intercept?"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Lieutenant Via: "Ninety minutes sir."</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "Are we close enough for a visual?"</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Lieutenant Via: "Yes sir."</span>
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">Captain Spydor: "On screen"</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	Visual inspection revealed the vessel was older class Romulan War Bird, it appeared battle scarred. Lieutenant
	Commander Ragis tried to hail the vessel but there was no response. Lieutenant Lacy was able to able to boost
	the range of ours comms relay using the deflector shield but there was still no response from the Romulan vessel.
	<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-style: italic">
		Captain Spydor: "Continue to monitor their position, inform we when they are thirty minutes from our position."
	</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	As the Romulan vessel approached nothing else could be learnt from scanning or hailing them. We changed course and
	they matched this. As a precaution we raised out shields in anticipation of their arrival. As the War Bird drew
	closer we detected them charging weapons. The following exchange of particle beam fire left their engines critically
	damaged with a catastrophic failure imminent.
	<br />
	<br />
	With little time to investigate due to our over zealous defence of the Brazier we were able to beam a probe to
	ships bridge as we retreated to a safe distance. The probe was able to transmit some data before it was destroyed
	as the War Brids warp reactor when critical. This revealed a number of corpses aboard, cause of death asphyxiation.
	<br />
	<br />
	We did not leave the encounter without sustaining damage, our shields were down 15% and a number on minor systems
	were in need or repair. Fortunately the crew were mostly unscathed, some minor injuries well within the expertise
	of Lieutenant Kerensky in medical.
	<br />
	<br />
	With repairs underway Lieutenant Via picked up two more vessels travelling at low warp. Both on intercept courses
	with us, both from the same area as the War Bird. With the nearest other federation vessel 15 hours away at
	maximum warp, we were on our own to deal with this.
	<br />
	<br />
	Lieutenant Shar suggested launching a probe to try and learn as much as possible before the ships arrived, this
	was a logic action to take. As the two vessels approached we determined one was a Romulan Cruiser and the other a 
	Klingon Cruiser. This illogical discovery clearly indicated this was not a Romulan assault.
	<br />
	<br />
	Using the probe as a relay we were able to beam an away team to the Romulan Cruiser. Once onboard Lieutenant
	Commander Ragis and Lieutenant Shar were unable to disable the ships engines but in an attempt to give us more
	time to deal with the Klingon ship they were able to jettison the warp core bring the ship to a halt. 
	<br />
	<br />
	As soon as the Romulan vessel was disabled the Kilgon cruiser turned back and started to fire on it. In the battle
	that followed we were able to destroy the Kilgon cruiser before it did any real damage to the Romulan vessel with
	the away team onboard.
	<br />
	<br />
	Meanwhile Lieutenant Shar had made a discovery in the computer systems of the Romulan ship, a virus seemed to be
	controlling the ship. He and Lieutenant Commander Ragis attempted to communicate with it without much luck. They
	did manage to trace is origin to the neutral zone and the ship was designated "38". Did this mean there were
	at least 38 infected ships?
	<br />
	<br />
	Lieutenant Via was able to detect the virus in the Brazier's systems. This must have been from our initial contact
	with the first vessel. Via was able to restart out systems isolating the virus into a separate sub-system. 
	As the computer came back online some thirty minutes later the virus was gone from the main systems but we
	detected another five ships on sensors 5 hours away at their current speed.
	<br />
	<br />
	We were able to isolate the frequency used to transmit the virus and create a transmission to disable it. Fortunately
	there were five targets to try this on. As predicated the we successfully transmitted the counter measure to these
	and the ships stopped in their tracks.
	<br />
	<br />
	We had inadvertently transmitted the virus to starfleet command in out earlier subspace transmissions with Admiral
	Sexton. After transmitting the virus cure to startfleet Sexton requested we bring the Romulan vessel back. It took some
	time but chief engineer Lieutenant Lacy was able to, with the help of his team, re-integrate the previously
	jettisoned warp core to the Romulan cruiser and we returned to dock with the Romulan ship close behind.
