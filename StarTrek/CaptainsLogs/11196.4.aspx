								As we continued our peaceful mission to patrol the boarder with the neutral zone my chief science officer and
								fellow Vulcan Via Lactea picked up the faint signature of an unidentified craft on long range scanners just
								inside the neutral zone.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								I ordered a change in course, diverting us from our patrol, taking us closer to the mystery vessel to better
								investigate this illogical discovery. Overcoming some operation issues Via was able to establish the presents
								of two faint life signs onboard the unidentified vessel.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								After further scans of the vessel and failed attempts to hail it crew,I ordered chief engineer Ned Stark
								to take the shuttle along with chief medical officer Alec Kerensky aka Snail to render assistance honouring
								our commitment to preserve life.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								As the away team crossed into the neutral zone and approached the unidentified vessel further scans indicated
								that the faint life signs were indeed humans and the vessel an older federation transport with its
								identification removed. The transport was powered down and life support failing but there were curiously high
								energy reading coming from its cargo bay.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Given the state of the craft and its location under the advisement for Snail I ordered the ship to be towed
								closer to the Brazier outside of the neutral zone. Ned showed mastery of his skills in rigging a tow
								mechanism and bringing the transport within 10,000m of the Brazier, maintaining a safe distance to protect
								the ship.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								The two humans on the transport and Snail were beamed to sick bay where a security detail was on standby.
								Following standard protocol a quarantine was established to protect the rest of the crew while Snail
								performed an examination.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Both crew from the transport were unconscious. Snail performed a complete examination revealing both were
								males in physiologically in their mid fifties but appearing older. Although unconscious from exposure
								seemly due to the failing life support in the transport both were stable.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								With the transport now much closer to the Brazier Via was able to conduct a detailed scan with the ships
								main sensor array. This shed little light on the transport its self but indicated the the high energy
								readings in its cargo bay appears to be some king of stasis technology.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								First officer Ragis and Ned beamed to the bridge of the transport in an attempt to uncover
								its origins. The technology of the transport was consistent with its external appearance, being an
								older federation vessel and Ned set about restoring power, but due to unfamiliarity with some of
								the older system indicated this might take some time. While Ned was busy Ragis started to
								explore the transport. Heading along the darkened corridor, light by only a torch, and down one level to
								the cargo bay.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Ragis reached the door to the cargo bay and making a curious discovery. The locking mechanism on the
								bay door seemed out of place on such and old transport. Despite his vast knowledge of cultures and
								languages the controls and technology of the lock seemed unfamiliar although there were some similarities
								with current federation technologies this was a curious discovery on such and old vessel. Ragis was
								unable to locate another way into the cargo bay.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								While Ned continued to work on restoring power I took the opportunity to make a subspace
								transmission of Star Fleet to try and identify the transport and its mission and crew roster.
								Without the registration that of ship, that had been removed form the outside, this was a futile endeavour.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Proving once again that his engineering expertise is unparalleled Ned managed to restore power
								and bring the transports computer online. The systems appeared unfamiliar to Ned, based on
								federation technology but significantly modified. On discovering this Ned requested assistance
								from Via to access the systems. Via beamed to the transport and on accessing the systems reported back
								that the systems would take some time to hack.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								While Via was working I received a communication from Ragis requesting that we wake one of the
								transports crew and attempt to get information from him. This seemed a logical course of action so
								I ordered Snail to revive one of the crew and speak to him.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								A short time later I received a report back from Snail confirming that one of the transports crew
								was wake and after some initial disorientation he had revealed that his name was Smyth P and crew
								mate Harry Mud. He confirmed the power lost on their ship was due to issues with the warp drive
								and claimed they were transporting food. When asked about the high energy signatures from the cargo
								bay Smyth became agitated and kept saying “It’s food, nothing dangerous”.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								With this new information and Via still working on the computers Ragis and I agreed the he would
								beam back to the Brazier and interrogate the second crew member (Harry). We first moved Smyth to
								the brig to keep them separated. After waking Harry, despite his legendary diplomacy and
								negotiation skills Ragis was not able to gain on more information.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								At this point I received a transmission from Via that the transports computers were now decrypted
								and under our control. From this he was able to determine the registration and origin (a plant in
								the neutral zone) of the transport but all details of its previous missions, cargo, crew and
								destination had been wiped. With this new information I made another subspace transmission to
								Star Fleet with the registration. This revealed the transport had disappeared almost 30 years ago
								and the Smyth and Harry were part of its original crew but should have been 20 years younger than
								they appeared. I order via to keep searching the ships computers.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Meanwhile Ned had worked out the cargo bay lock and gained access. Inside were 30 large
								containers. Scans of the bay and the containers showed nothing dangerous although the contents
								of the containers was masked by the stasis tech. Each container had foreign looking control panel,
								but given his experience with the bay door Ned was quickly able to open one discovering
								something that was indeed not food but a humanoid creature in stasis.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								On receiving this report I ordered all crew back to the ship and we beam one on the containers
								to a cargo bay on the Brazier setting up a secure quarantine zone around that whole section
								of the ship. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
								While the quarantine was being setup Ragis wen to the brig to speak to Smyth. At first he
								seemed surprised to at Ragis’ appearance and curiously had never seen a Catian before,
								but appeared confused by Ragis roll as first officer. During questioning Smyth insisted
								that the cargo was food but was not overly concerned when confronted with the truth. Neither
								did he seemed phased by the prospect of prison. At this point Ragis took an approach that
								caused me great concern, he threatened Smyth’s life if he did not start co-operating. This
								did not work and Smyth replied “Your Star Fleet, you won’t do anything”.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								With nothing new learned from the continued questioning of the transports crew I turned my
								attentions to the examination that Snail and Via were conducting in the cargo bay. Medical
								scans had confirmed that the humanoid creature was indeed not human and intact a species
								not in the Star Fleet database. It was bright peach with spots and a ridged forehead wearing
								rough clothing. Physiologically vey similar to humans suggests a potential common origin.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								At this point I decided to speak to both Smyth and Harry. Both were surprised by a Vulcan
								captain and had similar stories except for their destination. Neither seemed to know about
								the neutral zone treaty or were willing to disclose any further information about their
								cargo even in the face of formal prosecution for violation of numerous federation laws.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								By the time I was done with our now official prisoners. Via and Snail had made progress
								with the unknown humanoid cargo and had troubling findings to report. On waking the creature
								it had become clear we were looking at a violation of the prime directive. The creature was
								scared and unable to communicate at first. Its language was unbowed and the universal
								translator could not decipher it. Snail had managed some basic communication with gestures
								and managed to get the create to bring and eat something.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Given the severity of the situation I decided to seek the council of Admiral Sexton. His
								advise was to do what I deemed best as Captain. Knowing the course the transport had
								taken from its computer we scanned for M class planets where the creatures could have
								come from. Seeming now to have familiarised himself with the Brazier’s sensor system
								Via was able to complete the scans and found only possible place the creatures could
								have come from. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Having been able to restore warp drive to the transport the course of action of return
								these creatures to their home was clear. Snail was able to sedate the one we had woken
								and return it to the stasis container after wiping its memory. We beamed the container
								back to the transport then I lead the mission to return to the M class planet in the
								neutral zone, accompanied by Ragis, Ned, Via and Snail. The transport being
								an older vessel was only capable of warp 1.4 and it took several hours to reach the M
								class plant we found on sensors. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
								On arrival we scanned both the planet and surrounding area, confirming that these
								creatures were indeed from here and that this was a pre-warp civilisation. After
								returning all the creatures to the plant we set a course back to the Brazier. Along
								the was Ned and Via learnt all they could about the stasis technology of
								the containers. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Once back aboard the Brazier we set course for the nearest federation space station
								to hand Smyth and Harry over to security and the transport and containers for further
								investigation.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								While docked with the station we took the opportunity to take on supplies and perform
								routine maintenance before returning the patrol the board of the neutral zone.
